# SoulsborneCalulator
# After looking for way to quickly calculate how many souls you need to get from one specific level to another, I found nothing online.
# Everything had to be done by hand using the souls formula found before.
# So I created a quick calculator that can be done for any fromsoftware game using python
# I plan to make a full fledged website, but my skills are a bit far, so this is my first project to learn how to get into that!
# If you see any errors or could offer some improvements, please do.
